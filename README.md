<h1>Justin Lee - Weekly Scrum</h1><br>
<h2>Sprint #1 (9/30 - 10/06)</h2><br>

<h3>What tasks did I work on/complete?</h3><br>
<ul>
<li> 
From the first meeting, it was agreed that we would separate into two groups, that being the frontend team and backend team. Anna and I would be the frontend team, while Arselan and Poojitha were the backend team. From there, my responsibility was to think about potential tech stacks that I could suggest to the team. For the frontend team, I had suggested React, which Anna and I agreed to use. For the backend, my suggestion was to use Node because I have some experience with that particular technology. However, Arselan and Poojitha decided to use java as they both have experience with java. 
</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>What am I planning to work on next?</h3><br>
<ul>
<li> 
My next task was to put some thought into a needed functionality of the database, which would be searching for listings. Another task of mine was to begin researching how to deploy the frontend on AWS EC2 Cluster. 
</li><br>

The next task was to determine what kind of functionality we wanted for our application in order to have a minimal viable product. 
</li><br>
</ul>


<h3>What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?</h3><br>

Backend team was not able to get the APIs, therefore, Anna and I couldnâ€™t link the frontend to the backend. 
</li><br>
</ul>
